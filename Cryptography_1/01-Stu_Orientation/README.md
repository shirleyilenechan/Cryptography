# Orientation

In this activity, you'll familiarize yourself with some key terms in cryptography.

We'll cover each of these topics in-depth throughout the week. This exercise is simply meant to get you up to speed with the jargon before layering on depth.

## Instructions

### Goals of Cryptography

Use the resources provided to define, and provide an examples for, each of the following terms.

- Privacy - data and access is accessible and viewable only by the intended party(ies)

- Authenticity - the person taking an action is really who they claim to be 

- Integrity - without modification, untampered

- Non-Repudiation - associating an actor with an action so that the actor cannot claim they did not take that action

### Key Terms

- Plaintext - human readable text 

- Ciphertext - a message is transformed so that it cannot be read by unintended parties 

- Cryptography - the study and practice of how to transform messages and communications so that it is not ureadable or understandable to unintended parties 

- Code - method for concealing a message 

- Bit - smallest unit of data, represented as a 0 or 1 

- Cipher - a method or alogorithm used to transform plain text to cipher text

- Encryption Key - a variable / value used in the encryption of messages 

- Encryption - applying a cipher in order to transform plain text to cipher text 

- Decryption - applying the cipher in reverse in order to transform cipher text back to plain text 

- Symmetric-Key Cryptography - method of encryption using the same key for encryption and decryption

- Asymmetric-Key Cryptography - method of encryption using the different keys for encryption and decryption, where the public key is used to encrypt and the private key is used to decrypt 

- Hash Signature - a unique hash value generated for a file or message. 

- Checksum - The sender uses algorith to generate a value for a message and sender-receiver agree on a number to divide this message value by. If the remainder is the same when the receiver divides the received file's value, then the sent file and received file are the same.
